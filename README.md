The project is a simple React and Django page,that is a weather app, in which you can add a certain weather of a city in the exact hour, all you gotta do is input the city, the degrees and the condition of that exact time, and you will have an history of weathers.

## Install
#### Frontend
To run the frontend, first you gotta run the npm Install, to download all the packages that i used for this app, and later on, you can start the project with npm start
```bash
  npm install
```
```bash
  npm start
```

#### Backend
With django, the first thing is migrate the model of the database, you do that with the migrate command in the main branch of the folder, and later on, the back is ready to run, so you code the runserver
```bash
  python manage.py migrate
```
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

To get a full experience of the code, the frontend and the backend must be running at the same time, the backend at port 8000 and frontend at port 3000
